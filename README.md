# The Onion Test

I was surprised that I couldn't immediately find a little web game of the [Onion test](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Onion%20test) (maybe I missed it), so I made my own by scraping ~600 entries from [r/TheOnion](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOnion) and [r/nottheonion](https://reddit.com/r/nottheonion). 

In this game, some of the headlines look weird because The Onion Writes In All Uppercase Which Is A Stylistic Dead Giveaway Because No Newsroom Does This, so to counteract this I set the headlines to be lowercase except for the first character. 

This project is partially inspired by [Neal Agarwal's](https://neal.fun/) "[The Auction Game](https://neal.fun/auction-game/)", and the scoring system and confidence levels were taken from [here](https://acritch.com/credence-game/#scoring).
